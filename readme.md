### Getting Started
<div>
1. Connect your ESP device to a Wi-Fi network and obtain its IP address.
 <br>
2. Install the ESP Controller App.
 <br>
3. Open the app and tap the "search" button to add a new device.
 <br>
4. Tap "Modes" to select the modes.

 ## Troubleshooting

If you are unable to discover the ESP devices on the network, you may need to check the following:

- Ensure that the ESP devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your mobile device.
- Check that the ESP devices are powered on and connected to the network.
- Verify that the broadcast IP address used in the app matches the network configuration of your Wi-Fi network.
